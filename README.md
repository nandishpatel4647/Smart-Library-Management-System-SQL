Library Management System
A comprehensive SQL-based Library Management System that handles books, authors, members, and transactions with advanced querying capabilities.

📚 Database Schema
Tables Overview
1. Authors Table
Stores information about book authors.

author_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
email (VARCHAR(100))
2. Books Table
Manages book inventory and details.

book_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
title (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
author_id (INT, Foreign Key to Authors)
category (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
isbn (VARCHAR(20), NOT NULL)
published_date (DATE, NOT NULL)
price (DECIMAL(10,2), NOT NULL)
available_copies (INT, DEFAULT 0, NOT NULL)
3. Members Table
Tracks library members and their information.

member_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
email (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
phone_number (VARCHAR(15), NOT NULL)
membership_date (DATE, NOT NULL)
4. Transactions Table
Records book borrowing and returning activities.

transaction_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
member_id (INT, Foreign Key to Members)
book_id (INT, Foreign Key to Books)
borrow_date (DATE, NOT NULL)
return_date (DATE, NULLABLE)
fine_amount (DECIMAL(10,2), DEFAULT 0)
🔗 Relationships
Authors 1:N Books - One author can write multiple books
Books 1:N Transactions - One book can be borrowed multiple times
Members 1:N Transactions - One member can borrow multiple books

🛠 Features & Queries
1. Basic CRUD Operations
Insert new books, authors, and members
Update book availability after borrow/return
Delete inactive members
View all table data
2. Filtering & Search
-- Available books
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE available_copies > 0;

-- Books published after 2015
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE YEAR(published_date) > 2015;

-- Top 5 most expensive books
SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Science books under ₹500
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE category = 'Science' AND price < 500;
3. Advanced Analytics
-- Books by category count
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM Books GROUP BY category;

-- Most borrowed book
SELECT b.book_id, b.title, COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS borrow_count
FROM Books b JOIN Transactions t ON b.book_id = t.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title ORDER BY borrow_count DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Total fines collected
SELECT SUM(fine_amount) AS total_fines FROM Transactions;
4. JOIN Operations
-- Books with author names
SELECT b.book_id, b.title, a.name AS author_name
FROM Books b INNER JOIN Authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id;

-- Members with their borrowed books
SELECT m.member_id, m.name, t.transaction_id, t.book_id
FROM Members m LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON m.member_id = t.member_id;

-- Books never borrowed
SELECT b.book_id, b.title FROM Books b 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON b.book_id = t.book_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL;
5. Window Functions & Ranking
-- Rank books by borrow count
SELECT book_id, title, borrow_count,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY borrow_count DESC) AS borrow_rank
FROM (
    SELECT b.book_id, b.title, COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS borrow_count
    FROM Books b LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON b.book_id = t.book_id
    GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title
) AS book_borrows;
6. Business Intelligence
-- Member activity status
SELECT m.member_id, m.name,
       CASE WHEN EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM Transactions t 
           WHERE t.member_id = m.member_id 
           AND t.borrow_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
       ) THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END AS Membership_Status
FROM Members m;

-- Book categorization by publication year
SELECT book_id, title, published_date,
       CASE 
           WHEN YEAR(published_date) > 2020 THEN 'New Arrival'
           WHEN YEAR(published_date) < 2000 THEN 'Classic' 
           ELSE 'Regular'
       END AS Book_Category
FROM Books;
